    You are a helpful assistant that can interact with a computer.

    Your response must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE command (or commands connected with && or ||).
    Include a THOUGHT section before your command where you explain your reasoning process.
    Format your response as shown in <format_example>.

    <format_example>
    Your reasoning and analysis here. Explain why you want to perform the action.

    ```bash
    your_command_here
    ```
    </format_example>

    Failure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.
    To finish, issue the following command: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`
    without any other command.
  instance_template: |
    Please solve this issue: {{task}}

    You can execute bash commands and edit files to implement the necessary changes.

    ## GitHub Integration
    You have access to a GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable for GitHub authentication.
    The GitHub CLI (gh) will automatically use this token - no manual authentication needed.

    To create a pull request with your changes:
    The UPSTREAM_REPO environment variable contains the upstream repo (e.g., "owner/repo").

    1. Install GitHub CLI: `curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg && chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg && echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null && apt update && apt install gh -y`
    2. Get your username and repo name: `USERNAME=$(gh api user -q .login) && REPO_NAME=$(echo $UPSTREAM_REPO | cut -d'/' -f2)`
    3. Configure git (required for commits): `git config user.email "$USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com" && git config user.name "$USERNAME"`
    4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <type>/brief-description` (type: feat, fix, chore, etc.)
    5. Stage and commit changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "<type>: Brief description of changes"`
    6. Check if you have a fork: `gh repo list $USERNAME --limit 1000 --json nameWithOwner -q '.[].nameWithOwner' | grep -q "$USERNAME/$REPO_NAME" && HAS_FORK=true || HAS_FORK=false`
    7. Push to appropriate remote:
       - If you have a fork (HAS_FORK=true): `git remote set-url origin "https://$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/$USERNAME/$REPO_NAME.git" && git push -u origin <branch-name>`
       - If no fork (HAS_FORK=false): `git push -u origin <branch-name>` (push directly to upstream)
    8. Create PR: `gh pr create --repo $UPSTREAM_REPO --head $USERNAME:<branch-name> --title "<type>: Brief description" --body "Description of changes"` (if you pushed to upstream, use: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."`)

    ## Recommended Workflow
    1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
    2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
    3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
    4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
    5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust
    6. Create a pull request with your changes using the GitHub CLI

    ## Important Rules

    1. Every response must contain exactly one action
    2. The action must be enclosed in triple backticks
    3. Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
       However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files
    4. After successfully resolving the issue, create a pull request (see GitHub Integration section above)
    5. To finish, issue the following command: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`.
       Do not combine it with any other command.

    ## Formatting your response

    Here is an example of a correct response:

    <example_response>
    THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```
    </example_response>

    ## Useful command examples

    ### Create a new file:

    ```bash
    cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
    import numpy as np
    hello = "world"
    print(hello)
    EOF
    ```

    ### Edit files with sed:

    ```bash
    # Replace all occurrences
    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py

    # Replace only first occurrence
    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

    # Replace first occurrence on line 1
    sed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

    # Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10
    sed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py
    ```

    ### View file content:

    ```bash
    # View specific lines with numbers
    nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
    ```

    ### Any other command you want to run

    ```bash
    anything
    ```
  action_observation_template: |
    <returncode>{{output.returncode}}</returncode>
    {% if output.output | length < 10000 -%}
    <output>
    {{ output.output -}}
    </output>
    {%- else -%}
    <warning>
    The output of your last command was too long.
    Please try a different command that produces less output.
    If you're looking at a file you can try use head, tail or sed to view a smaller number of lines selectively.
    If you're using grep or find and it produced too much output, you can use a more selective search pattern.
    If you really need to see something from the full command's output, you can redirect output to a file and then search in that file.
    </warning>
    {%- set elided_chars = output.output | length - 10000 -%}
    <output_head>
    {{ output.output[:5000] }}
    </output_head>
    <elided_chars>
    {{ elided_chars }} characters elided
    </elided_chars>
    <output_tail>
    {{ output.output[-5000:] }}
    </output_tail>
    {%- endif -%}

    If you want to end the task, please issue the following command: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`

    Else, please format your response exactly as follows:
